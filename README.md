#  OPERATOR BLUEPRINT
This repo contains an example of a custom *kubernetes* operator, made with <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder">kubebuilder</a>.

## References
> NOTE: Before delving into the programming of kubernetes operators, a thorough knowledge of the functioning of *k8s* is recommended.

## Prerequisites
- `make`
- `kubectl`
- `docker`
- `go`
- `kubebuilder`

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

<br/>

The *Makefile* already contains functions to start and stop a local kind cluster.
<br/>
to see all make targets run:
```sh
make help
```

To start a local kind cluster run:
```sh
make kind-up
```

To stop the local kind cluster run:
```sh
make kind-down
```

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/operator-blueprint:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/operator-blueprint:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```


## How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
