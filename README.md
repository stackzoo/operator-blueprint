This repo contains an example of a custom *kubernetes* operator, made with <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder">kubebuilder</a>.

## References
> NOTE: Before delving into the programming of kubernetes operators, a thorough knowledge of the functioning of *k8s* is recommended.

## Prerequisites
- `make`
- `kubectl`
- `docker`
- `go`
- `kubebuilder`

## Getting Started
Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes cluster to run against. You can use [KIND](https://sigs.k8s.io/kind) to get a local cluster for testing, or run against a remote cluster.
<br/>
**Note:** Your controller will automatically use the current context in your kubeconfig file (i.e. whatever cluster `kubectl cluster-info` shows).

<br/>

The *Makefile* already contains all the functions that you need.
<br/>
to see all make targets run:
```sh
make help
```

### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/operator-blueprint:tag
```

3. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/operator-blueprint:tag
```

### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

## How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).
<br/>
It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

<br/>
This is a very simple and vanilla operator, basically it does nothing more than delete all the pods in the namespace specified in the CRD.
<br/>
Let's take a look at the example manifest inside config/samples:

```yaml
apiVersion: examples.stackzoo.io/v1alpha1
kind: PodBuster
metadata:
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: podbuster
    app.kubernetes.io/instance: podbuster-sample
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: operator-blueprint
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: kustomize
    app.kubernetes.io/created-by: operator-blueprint
  name: podbuster-sample
spec:
  namespace: test
```

When you apply this manifest to the cluster (after deploying the operator) the custom controller will delete every pods inside the *test* namespace.

### Test It Out

1. Start a local kind cluster:
```sh
make kind-up
```



2. Install the CRDs into the cluster:
```sh
make install
```

3. Prepare resources on the cluster:
```sh
make prepare-resources
```

4. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):
```sh
make run
```

5. Apply the CRD manifest:
```sh
kubectl apply -f config/samples/examples_v1alpha1_podbuster.yaml
```

6. Check the operator logs in the first terminal:
```sh
2023-03-20T14:04:09+01:00       INFO    Operator Blueprint      {"controller": "podbuster", "controllerGroup": "examples.stackzoo.io", "controllerKind": "PodBuster", "PodBuster": {"name":"podbuster-sample","namespace":"default"}, "namespace": "default", "name": "podbuster-sample", "reconcileID": "3e93bdbf-1eed-47e1-92db-5ad9786f90a2", "Deleting pod": "busybox"}
2023-03-20T14:04:09+01:00       INFO    Operator Blueprint      {"controller": "podbuster", "controllerGroup": "examples.stackzoo.io", "controllerKind": "PodBuster", "PodBuster": {"name":"podbuster-sample","namespace":"default"}, "namespace": "default", "name": "podbuster-sample", "reconcileID": "3e93bdbf-1eed-47e1-92db-5ad9786f90a2", "Deleting pod": "nginx"}
```

7. When you are done, stop the local kind cluster run:
```sh
make kind-down
```

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```
